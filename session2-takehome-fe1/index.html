          <h3>Life of Pi</h3>
          <img src="p2.jpg" alt="" width="256px" height="400px" />
          <h4>By Yann Martel</h4>
          <p>
            After deciding to sell their zoo in India and move to Canada,
            Santosh and Gita Patel board a freighter with their sons and a few
            remaining animals. Tragedy strikes when a terrible storm sinks the
            ship, leaving the Patels' teenage son, Pi (Suraj Sharma), as the
            only human survivor. However, Pi is not alone; a fearsome Bengal
            tiger has also found refuge aboard the lifeboat. As days turn into
            weeks and weeks drag into months, Pi and the tiger must learn to
            trust each other if both are to survive.

          <img src="p4.jpg" alt="" width="256px" height="400px" />
          <h4>By Kathryn Stockett</h4>
          <p>
            In 1960s Mississippi, Southern society girl Skeeter (Emma Stone)
            returns from college with dreams of being a writer. She turns her
            small town on its ear by choosing to interview the Black women who
            have spent their lives taking care of prominent white families. Only
            Aibileen (Viola Davis), the housekeeper of Skeeter's best friend,
            will talk at first. But as the pair continue the collaboration, more
            women decide to come forward, and as it turns out, they have quite a
            lot to say.
