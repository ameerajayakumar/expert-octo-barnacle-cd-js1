Your QTrip website will have these 3 pages

Adventures Grid Page - This is the page that you’ll get to by clicking on one of the city cards on the Landing Page. It lists the Adventures available for that city.
Adventure Details Page - This is the page that you’ll get to by clicking on one of the Adventures on the Adventures Grid Page. It lists details about that particular Adventure.

Background
The focus of this Micro-Experience (ME) is to use HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills to create a Frontend website. QTrip has this travel website where users can browse the various Adventures on offer, based on their places of interest and book an Adventure.

They can navigate between the pages by clicking on the cards and using the navigation bar.
The website can also be viewed on other devices such as smartphones and tablets.

You are building static web pages in this ME. Some of the more dynamic features will get added in the next QTrip ME.
